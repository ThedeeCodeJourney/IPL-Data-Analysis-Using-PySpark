# IPL-Data-Analysis-Using-PySpark
Introduction
The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular and competitive cricket leagues in the world, attracting players and fans from all over the globe. With a vast amount of data generated from each match, it presents a great opportunity for data analysis. This project leverages PySpark, a powerful big data processing framework, to analyze IPL data and uncover valuable insights. The analysis covers various aspects such as match performance, player statistics, and the impact of toss decisions on match outcomes. This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of PySpark in handling large datasets and performing complex data transformations and analysis.

Key Objectives

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:

Efficiently load large datasets containing ball-by-ball details, match information, player statistics, and team data.
Clean the data by filtering out invalid entries such as wides and no-balls to ensure accurate analysis.

2. Performance Analysis:

Calculate total and average runs scored in each match and innings.
Determine the running total of runs scored over the course of each match using window functions.

3. Player and Match Impact:

Identify high impact balls, such as those resulting in wickets or high run deliveries, to highlight key moments in matches.
Categorize wins based on margin and analyze the impact of the toss on match outcomes.

4. Insights and Visualizations:

Analyze player performance across seasons to identify top-scoring batsmen and economical bowlers.
Visualize the impact of winning the toss on match outcomes and the average runs scored by batsmen in winning matches.
